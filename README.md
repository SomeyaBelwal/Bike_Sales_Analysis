# Bike_Sales_Analysis
I am practicing my Data Analytics and Data Visualisation skills using excel. During the proces,I learned the importance of requirements gathering so you can produce exactly what the client requested.
Steps involved:
* Collecting dataset
This dataset is collected from Kaggle. It includes the following columns:"coustmer ID","Marital Status","Gender","Income","Education","Occupation","Commute Distance","region","age brackets","purchased brackets".
* Data Cleaning
It includes removing duplicate values, generating columns, working on empty cells
* Data Visualization - creating pivot tables
A pivot table is specially designed for querying large amounts of data in many user friendly way.
* Designing dashboard
